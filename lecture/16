Time:
- HZ  tick rate allways 100 from user space
 - Less latency at higher tickrates
- jiffies
 - Number of ticks since boof
 - time-after
 - time-before
- Syncronization
 - Atomic variables:
  - indivisible
  - cannot be subdivided
  - cannot seperate and update
  - Gauranteed to happen
  - Atomic noop still happens or notification of failure
  - Ordering is not gauranteed
  - integer types only
 - spinlock
  - Busy waiting
  - you need to know how much you have to wait
  - use onky for periodic events
   - Timer interrupt
  - do not use for user I/O
 - semaphors -> general purpose construct.
  - binary -> mutex
  - mutex type
 - Mutex
  - NOT SAME AS LAST ONE!
 - Barrier

- Deadlock:
 - system stops when every one is waiting on a recource some one else is holding on to
 - Programatic solution:
  - numerical ID and inquire resources in numerical order

- Filesystem:
 - Capabilities
 - abstractions
 - implementation details
 - 3 main requirments:
  - Hold large amount of data
  - persistant storage
  - Multi access  at the same time
 - stored in sequence of bytes
 - not contiguous physically but logically are
 - record base <- refs (Re- FS)
 - hierarchical structure -> HDF, netCDM

- FileType
 - magic number
 - file extention

- File attributes -> meta data
