Time:
- CPU
- world clock
- reletive
- absolute (every one has the same refrence EPOC)
- HZ tick rate of system (100 on default on system)

___
Caching (memoization)
- locality
 - time: guessing reuse of a file
 - space: if one block of the file is used, other might be used soon
- faster i/o on average
- amertization
 - (hit rate * cache access time) + ((1- hit rate)(disk access time))
- backing store
 - source of data (canonical)
- data gets cached several times on the hard drive
 - hardware and software level
- writing
 - write through
 - write back
 - sometimes we need atomic variable access
  - every change occures, no compiler ptimization
  - set by system configuration, OS gives you options

- Ideal eviction strategy:
 - throw out the least useful block
 - LRU least recent used
 - LRU-n, n is 2 in linux: LRU-2:

	  Hot list
	    _ _ _
	   |_|_|_|
   
	  Cold list
	 _ _ _ _ _ _
	|_|_|_|_|_|_|
  - stores as radix tree


- i9
 - l3 is now non inclusive cache
 - increase hit rate
 - increase l2
 -
