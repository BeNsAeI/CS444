- freezes: use command mode, or kill it from other process
- Activate networking if you want to scpfiles to qemu
- qemu actually runs on a screen session
- becareful to keep a backup in case of bad crash

Disk scheduling

- Block devices
 - smallest hardware addressable:
  - sector

 - smallest software addressable:
  - block
  - block = n*sector where n is a natural number (1,2,3,...,8)
   - typically block = sector

 - largest software addressable:
  - 1 page (8 sectors)

 - SSDs:
  - read 1 sector
  - write 1 page

Abstraction:
- buffer heads:
 - blocks in memory are called buffer
 - bio struct:
  - represent in-flight i/o operation
   - in-flight: active operation (requested but not completed)
  - uses scatter/gather I/O (BIO VEC)

  - fragmentation and fragmented data
  - (mac defragments on the fly)
  - stores I/O op as list of segments
   - segment is a subset of buffer

Request:
- doubly linked list of bio struct
- in SSDs queues are mostly FIFOs

I/O schedulers:

- merge requests
 - front: merge it to the front of an existing request
 - back: oposite of that
  - CONFUSING!
- Sort requests (relative to current location)
- Maximize throughput
- elevator
