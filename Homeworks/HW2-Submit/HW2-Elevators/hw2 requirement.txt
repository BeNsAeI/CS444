Choose either both directions of travel or only servicing in one direction (LOOK or C-LOOK)
There will be at least 2 sorts involved.
Don't forget to MERGE. Either front or back, not both.
You will need to disable virtio on qemu in order to do this assignment.



tip:
you will need to generate some I/O. you will need to write a script that does this WHICH RUNS ON THE VM

outputing sector numbers in requested order is a good first step.

in order to select this scheduler, you will need to either pass it as a command line option or use the 
/sys/block/hdc/queue/scheduler file at run time

you need to ensure you are using the kernel you bulit , or this won't work

you have to add some contents to the kconfig.iosched file in the block directory to get the file to complie.

you should make a copy of noop-iosched.c, call it sttf-iosched.c, and do a find /replace all instances of noop
to sstf

you should be maintaining the queue in sorted order. Basically, use insertion sort.
