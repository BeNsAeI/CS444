Problem 1:

As long as there are fewer than three processes using the resource, new processes can start using it right away.
Once there are three processes using the resource, all three must leave before any new processes can begin using it.


Problem 2:

Some useful constraints:
Customers invoke get_hair_cut when sitting in the barber chair.
If the shop is full, a customer exits the shop.
The barber thread invokes cut_hair.
cut_hair and get_hair_cut should always be executing concurrently, for the same duration.
Your solution should be valid for any number of chairs.
